## 1. Purpose

This Agreement provides a standardised framework for resolving or preventing harms linked to behavioural modification systems (BMS). It is designed to support jurisdictional adaptation, public-interest litigation, ethical reform, and strategic settlements across sectors and borders.

## 2. Scope

This Agreement applies to harms arising from the use or design of systems intended to modify, steer, or exploit user behaviour at scale. Relevant harms include, but are not limited to:

    Digital addiction and compulsive use

    Youth mental health degradation

    Self-harm and suicide ideation

    Algorithmic discrimination and radicalisation

    Exploitative monetisation (e.g. loot boxes, dark patterns)

    Involuntary surveillance and behavioural targeting

    Incitement to violence, genocide, or social unrest

## 3. Acknowledgement of Harm

Parties using or citing this Agreement acknowledge the occurrence of significant, avoidable harms connected to behavioural modification systems. Such use does not constitute an admission of legal liability.

## 4. Licensing Terms

Not-for-profit (NFP) entities may use this Agreement freely under the Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0) licence.

For-profit (FP) entities must obtain a licence per jurisdiction and/or vertical, except when acting under the pro bono terms in Clause 5.

## 5. Pro Bono Use Clause

To expedite justice or settlement in time-sensitive cases, solicitors and legal professionals may invoke this Agreement without prior licensing. Post-facto licensing and fair compensation are encouraged, but not mandatory. This clause does not waive other parties' rights or restrict formal licensing frameworks.

## 6. Chain Referral Clause

Institutional users of the BMSMSA are encouraged to refer three or more peer organisations to increase adoption and accountability. Where safe, these referrals may be logged (without personal data) to visualise ethical spread and jurisdictional uptake.

## 7. Platform Participation

Digital platform operators may align with this Agreement through:

    Transparent disclosure of algorithmic systems

    External auditing or impact review

    Participation in structured settlement processes

    Co-development of safeguards, especially for minors and vulnerable users

Participation is voluntary. Absence of platform adoption does not restrict litigation or policy adoption by other actors.

## 8. Value Chain of Harm and Engagement Priority

Responsibility for BMS-related harms is distributed across a complex, multi-actor supply chain. While no single party is solely accountable, some are better positioned to enable reform, resolve legacy harm, or adopt protective practices.

Those constituents of the behavioural modification supply chain most likely to benefit from early settlement, licensing, or ethical alignment include:

    Professional service providers
    (e.g. consultants, public relations firms, ethics auditors, multi-sector advisers)

    Advertising and ad tech actors
    (targeting platforms, campaign intermediaries, brand-facing optimisers)

    Application developers
    (particularly those monetising via youth, gambling, microtransactions, or nudge design)

    Legal and compliance advisers
    (with visibility into risk, governance, or platform regulation)

    Payment intermediaries
    (enabling behavioural monetisation through app stores, wallets, or spending triggers)

    Academic institutions and legal clinics
    (engaged in public interest litigation, ethics research, or legal education)

    Platform operators
    (hosting, amplifying, or monetising user behaviour through algorithmic engagement)

    Algorithm designers and AI vendors
    (providing the underlying systems for sorting, ranking, and modifying user behaviour)

    Data brokers
    (entities aggregating, refining, or trading behavioural and psychographic data)

    Cloud infrastructure and hosting providers
    (data centres, scalable compute, content delivery networks)

    Telecommunications providers and ISPs
    (broadband, mobile, and connectivity actors involved in the distribution of BMS-enabled content)

    Lobbyists and trade associations
    (especially where strategic delay or policy shaping has limited reform)

    Regulators and statutory bodies
    (where oversight failure or underenforcement may have enabled systemic harm)

Engagement from these sectors may include:

    Quiet citation or internal adoption

    Voluntary licensing requests

    Contribution to audits or reform templates

    Public participation in early adopter networks or policy design

## 9. Whistleblower Mechanism

The BMSMSA does not store or receive evidence directly.
Individuals with credible disclosures are encouraged to report via secure, independent channels.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) is recommended for encrypted submission:
https://www.icij.org/leak/
Whistleblowers are advised to seek legal counsel before disclosure.

## 10. Early Adopter Pathway

Eligible early adopters (e.g. law schools, clinics, ethics centres) may:

    Be publicly recognised as participants

    Receive template support and strategic guidance

    Contribute to adaptation or regional tailoring
