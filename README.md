# Behavioural Modification Master Settlement Agreement (BMSMSA)

## What is the BMSMSA?

The BMSMSA is a public-interest legal framework designed to help address the harms caused by behavioural modification systems (BMS) — including digital addiction, algorithmic exploitation, and targeted manipulation. It enables coordinated ethical action, strategic settlement, and litigation support across sectors and jurisdictions.


## Stakeholders and the Behavioural Supply Chain

Behavioural modification systems (BMS) involve complex, multi-actor ecosystems. The BMSMSA addresses harm at every layer of the supply chain.

Key actors include:

- **Platform Operators** – Algorithm designers, recommender systems, and engagement optimisers.
- **Application Developers** – Especially those targeting youth, monetising compulsive behaviour, or using dark patterns.
- **Advertisers and Ad Tech Firms** – Targeting networks, campaign intermediaries, and brand-facing optimisers.
- **Professional Services** – Consultants, ethics auditors, public relations advisers, legal and compliance firms.
- **Legal Funders and Litigation Enablers** – Firms and financiers supporting mass claims, systemic redress, or strategic litigation.
- **Data Brokers and Analytics Vendors** – Entities aggregating, refining, or monetising psychographic and behavioural data.
- **Infrastructure Providers** – Hosting services, CDNs (Cloud Delivery Networks), cloud platforms, and mobile/broadband network operators.
- **Payment Gateways and Monetisation Enablers** – App stores, e-wallets, buy-now-pay-later providers, and other frictionless payment actors.
- **Academic Institutions and Legal Clinics** – Law schools, ethics centres, and public-interest litigation hubs.
- **Regulators and Statutory Bodies** – Enforcement agencies, ombuds, and standards-setting organisations.
- **Lobbyists and Trade Associations** – Especially those contributing to strategic delay, regulatory avoidance, or obfuscation.
- **Certification and Standards Bodies** – Including those influencing tech ethics codes, safety ratings, or ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) benchmarks.
- **Public and Philanthropic Funders** – Those enabling (or neglecting) ethics research, systemic reform, and early warning systems.

Each group can:

- **Reference or align** with the BMSMSA
- **Request a licence** for adaptation or use
- **Contribute to early adoption**, auditing, or ethical reform

We welcome interest and collaboration across all sectors.
